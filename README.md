## Some comments

- Added some tests in an effort to show that I'm familiar with testing frameworks (used react-testing-library)

- Uses scss because that's what I've been using recently. Used a simple approach that works well which is to separate the css by component by having a "master" class for the container for the component (e.g. flight-lists). This way eliminating unwanted interactions between styles. Although in such a small example that would hardly be a problem.

- Used semantic ui to add a little bit of niceness to how the list looks like. I'm very familiar with bootstrap as well.

- The projects workspace has checkJS enabled (VSCode -> Preferences -> Settings -> CheckJS) which adds a bit of typechecking.

- Added js docs annotations so I could have intellisense
